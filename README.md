# First React Project
This is my first step towards learning the Javascript framework React. I put least efforts on having a good UI and mainly focussed on understanding the basics of React Hooks and how the different components work together.

# Description
This application is a basic To Do List manager with functionalities to add and delete tasks. It also makes use of the local storage to store the current list items in the browser which shows up even when the app is closed and reopened.
